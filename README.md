# can-upgrade

To convert your mustache files to stache for the whole project, just run this in the terminal:

```
./node_modules/.bin/can-upgrade ./
```

It will do all the tedious parts for you and minimize the effort of your upgrade!

It does not make the changes for templates written inline in your JavaScript so once it finishes, it will tell you what files to check manually if there are any.
