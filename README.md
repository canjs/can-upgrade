# can-upgrade

To convert your project template files from mustache to stache, just run this in the terminal:

```shell
npm install can-upgrade
./node_modules/.bin/can-upgrade ./
```

It does all the tedious parts for you and minimizes the upgrade effort!

However, it does not make changes to templates written inline in your JavaScript. A list of files that should be checked manually is provided at the end.
